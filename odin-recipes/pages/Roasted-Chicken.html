    <p>
      This roasted chicken recipe is the way my grandmother used to make it.
      This method results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the
      celery after it was cooked.

      <h2>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken
        recipe of your life:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird
          is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black
          pepper, and onion powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and
          gives the seasonings something to adhere to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal
          flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the
          chicken cooks.
        </li>
      </ul>
