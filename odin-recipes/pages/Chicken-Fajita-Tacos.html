      The chicken for these chicken fajita tacos marinates overnight, so youâ€™ll
      need to plan ahead, but when it comes to preparing dinner, your tacos will
      be ready in under 30 minutes.

        How to make Chicken fajitas Step-By-Step
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make
        homemade roasted chicken:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine orange juice, taco seasoning, and vegetable oil in a large
          resealable bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out
          excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>
          Cook chicken in the hot skillet for 5 minutes. Add onion, green bell
          pepper, and red bell pepper. Cook until peppers are crisp tender, 4 to
          5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into center of chicken
          strips should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat tortillas until soft and pliable. Top with chicken fajita
          mixture, avocado, sour cream, and cotija cheese. Serve immediately
        </li>
      </ol>
