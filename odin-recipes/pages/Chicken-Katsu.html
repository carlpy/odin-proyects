    <p>
      Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe
      and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of
      chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

      <p>
        These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest Chicken katsu
        recipe of your life:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and
          pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and
          promotes browning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature
          crunch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or
          vegetable oil.
        </li>
      </ul>
